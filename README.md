# elen
The project files for **Exit Light, Enter Night**. ELEN is a first-person singleplayer horror game. It is unfinished and is unplayable as of this commit. ELEN is built with ROBLOX. This allows for unlimited creative flexibility while also avoiding the need to implement tedious backend functionality.  While developing this game, I learned 3D modeling, Lua, client-server interactions and memory optimization. I began working on this during summer 2020.

Due to the nature of the design process, it is cumbersome to update this repository after every significant file change. Consequently, this repository receives infrequent commits, and consecutive commits achieve vastly different goals.
