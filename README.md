# elen
The project files for **Exit Light, Enter Night**. ELEN is a first-person singleplayer horror game. It is *very* unfinished. ELEN is built with ROBLOX. This allows for unlimited creative flexibility while also avoiding the need to implement tedious backend functionality.  While developing this game, I learned 3D modeling, Lua, client-server interactions and memory optimization.
